# geometric-shapes-collision
This project implements an application using Windows Forms to draw geometric shapes and observe their collisions. Users can create different shapes and visualize how they interact with each other, providing an interactive way to learn about geometry and collision detection.

## Notes
This project was developed as the second assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course in the second semester of my 1st year at Sakarya University.
